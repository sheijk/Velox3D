 <h1>Velox Services</h1>
 <p>
 A Service is a piece of software which provides a well defined set of functionality to the Velox
 System. It uses the <a href="ObjectRegistry.html">Object Registry</a> to register one or more
 objects to the system under a well known name through which the whole functionality of the service
 is accessible.
