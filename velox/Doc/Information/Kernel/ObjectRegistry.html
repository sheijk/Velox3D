 <h1>The Object Registry</h1>
 <p>
 The object registry is a singleton object which maintains a mapping between managed objects 
 and unique keys. What it does: <br>
 - objects can be registered and unregistered <br>
 - the key of a known object can be retrieved <br>
 - an object can be retrieved using a known key <br>
 - a new unique key can be generated <br>
 - objects can specify the key they are registed with <br>
 - keys can be converted to and from std::string <br>
 </p>
 <p>
 Objects that shall be registered at the registry need to be derived from the class VNamedObject.
 Object keys are of type VObjectKey.
