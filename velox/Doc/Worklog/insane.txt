Personal Notes:

TODO: write VCOlor3f and use it in VImportedMaterialDescription

make physic states non copyable and assignable

TODO List:
- FIX the memleak in VPhyicWorld DeleteBodyPairList()

- Console is closeable with alt f4


- Indoor Rendering


medium:
- add multiple window ogl context sharing support
- fix WxConnector and old non needed wx stuff + make it clean and safe

high:
- move othro vector extractor of planeMesh into mathlib
- rewrite Physic code to use rigidbody in lib

- TODO check external libs for correct debug information
- TODO rewrite Velocity2 into Hinge2 instead of Joint!
- build in vfs saving for image saving

- ODE indepenadnt frame movement

- klaeren, warum es 2 VRBTransforms in /Math und /EntityParts gibt
	- namespace in math rbtransform aendern

- SetTrasnform RigidBody zurueckfuehren

  Brauchen utils workspace ! [!!!!!]
- Cannot step into exception thrower
- Exception throw cannot be relocated (says what throws exception but not who
  called service and tried to handle unspecified request)
