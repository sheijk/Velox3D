	  <h1>SmartPointer Tutorial</h1>
	  <h2>Simple usage</h2>
	  <p>
	  SmartPointers are small utility classes which act exactly like normal
	  pointers and provide some extra functionality like guarantueing that
	  the object they point to will be deleted.<br>
	  Velox's smart pointers can be used exactly like any common pointer. So
	  instead of writing <br>
	  <div id="cpp">
	  MyClass* pInstance = new MyClass(); <br>
	  if( pInstance == 0 ) alert("krawae!"); <br>
	  pInstance->foo(3); <br>
	  delete pInstance; <br>
	  pInstance = 0; <br>
	  </div>
	  you can write <br>
	  <div id="cpp">
	  VPointer<MyClass>::AutoPtr pInstance = new MyClass(); <br>
	  if( pInstance == 0 ) alert("krawae!"); <br>
	  pInstance->foo(3);<br>
	  </div>
	  The SmartPointer will delete his subject once it is destroyed itself.
	  Use a smart pointer exactly like a normal pointer. You can assign values,
	  other smart pointers of the same type (or of compatible types if supported
	  by the smart pointer class), compare two smart pointers, compare smart
	  pointer and normal pointers, etc. <br>
	  Additionally, smart pointers provide the following functions:
	  <div id="cpp">
	  // get a pointer to the target <br>
	  T* Get(); <br>
	  const T* Get() const; <br>
	  // assign new target <br>
	  void Assign(T*); <br>
	  // release it (reset to 0) <br>
	  void Release(); <br>
	  </div>
	  </p>

	  <h2>Important techniques</h2>

	  <h3>Resource aquisition is intialization</h3>
	  <p>
	  Use smart pointers for the "resource aquisition is intialization" idiom.
	  Instead of using pure pointers use a smart pointer when working with
	  dynamically allocated memory. <br>
	  Might the following code cause memory leaks?
	  <div id="cpp">
	  MyClass* pInstance = new MyClass(); <br>
	  foo(pInstance); <br>
	  delete pInstance; <br>
	  </div>
	  Yes! Imaging the function foo to throw an exception. If an exception is thrown
	  the delete statement will never be reached and the memory won't be released.
	  Thus this litte innocent piece of code introduced a mean memory leak to
	  our program. <br>
	  Now consider this version:
	  <div id="cpp">
	  VPointer<MyClass>::AutoPtr pSaveInstance = new MyClass(); <br>
	  foo(pSaveInstance.Get()); <br>
	  </div>
	  Now if foo throws an exception the stack will be unrolled an the AutoPtr
	  instance will be destroyed and delete it's target. Now we have code which
	  is both shorter and won't cause any surprising problems.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Don't trust the user</h3>
	  Imagine a simple file class which wraps the FILE handle and guarantees
	  the file to be closed. Let it be created by a factory method which returns
	  a pointer to the file class. Look at this code:
	  <div id="cpp">
	  File* pFile = FileManager::Open("testfile.dat"); <br>
	  pFile->WriteInt(3); <br>
	  </div>
	  Obviously, the user forgot to delete the File object after he used it. Thus
	  the file will never be closed leaving an open file handle which forces the
	  user to restart his machine if he wants to use the file again. Quite an awkward
	  result of a simple error. Using a smart pointer this problem can be completely
	  eliminated. We change the definition of our FileManger class:
	  <div id="cpp">
	  class FileManager { <br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// use a typedef for ease of use and to be able to change the used
	  smart pointer class easily <br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;typedef VPointer<File>::AutoPtr FilePtr; <br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FilePtr Open(string); <br>
	  }; <br>
	  </div>
	  Now the code is as simple as before, but protects the user from tedious errors:
	  <div id="cpp">
	  FileManager::FilePtr pFile = FileManager::Open("testfile.dat"); <br>
	  pFile->WriteInt(3);
	  </div>
	  Always use this technique when adding a factory method to a service.

	  <h2>Standard SmartPointer Types</h2>
	  <p>
	  There are several smart pointer types defined in &lt;v3d/Core/SmartPtr/VGuards.h&gt;:
	  </p>

	  <h3>AutoPtr</h3>
	  <p>
	  A pointer with an "exclusive owner" policy. This means, that only one smart
	  pointer can own and point to one subject at a time. When the smart pointer
	  is copied, the source is reset to 0. Thus, the AutoPtr cannot be used in
	  STL collections. (see std::auto_ptr for more info, AutoPtr models it's
	  behaviour). <br>
	  Example:
	  <div id="cpp">
	  VPointer<MyClass>::AutoPtr pAutoPtr = new MyClass(); <br>
	  VPointer<MyClass>::AutoPtr pSecondPtr; <br>
	  pSecondPtr = pAutoPtr; <br>
	  // pSecondPtr assumed the ownership of the MyClass target instance
	  if( pAutoPtr != 0 || pSecondPtr == 0 ) throw AnException("AutoPtr malfunction"); <br>
	  </div>
	  </p>

	  <h3>SharedPtr</h3>
	  <p>
	  A smart pointer class which implements a simple reference counting strategy.
	  For each target a reference count is maintained which keeps track how many
	  pointers use the target. Once a target is not used by any pointer any more
	  it is deleted. <br>
	  Each smart pointer has a pointer to a shared storage which stores a pointer
	  to the target and the reference count. When a pointer is assigned to a value
	  a new shared storage is created with it's ref count initialized to 1. When
	  a pointer is copied/assigned to another smart pointer it's shared storage's
	  ref count is increased. When a SharedPtr is assigned a new value it's old
	  target's ref count is decreased. When the ref counts reaches zero the
	  target will be deleted. <br>
	  A SharedPtr can safely be used in STL containers like std::list. <br>
	  Example:
	  <div id="cpp">
	  VPointer<MyClass>::SharedPtr pSharedPtr, pSharedPtr2, pSharedPtr3; <br>
	  pSharedPtr = new MyClass(); <br>
	  pSharedPtr2 = pSharedPtr; <br>
	  // now both smart pointer refer to the same object, it's ref count is 2 <br>
	  pSharedPtr = 0;
	  // only pSharedPtr2 points to the target, it's ref count is 1 <br>
	  pSharedPtr2 = pSharedPtr3;
	  // no more pointers point to the target, it is deleted <br>
	  </div>
	  </p>

	  <h3>AutoPtr and SharedPtr for arrays</h3>
	  <p>
	  <div id="cpp">
	  VArray<MyClass>::AutoPtr myAutoArray = new MyClass[100]; <br>
	  VArray<MyClass>::SharedPtr mySharedArray = new MyClass[3]; <br>
	  <br>
	  myAutoArray[4].foo(); <br>
	  mySharedArray[2].foo(); <br>
	  </div>
