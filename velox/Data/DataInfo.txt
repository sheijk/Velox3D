This directory contains data needed for the example applications and the editor. The "edit" directory contains data which may be edited in the editor. These are mostly pretty small xml/text files. They are managed in the subversion repository. Bigger binary files are put in the "data" directory which is excluded from subversion. To run the examples you will need to obtain it from the velox ftp server (it should be available from the velox website, too). If you intend to add your own date we recommend putting it inside a "local" file so that it won't conflict with new files in the subversion repository. Don't forget to mount add it inside the vfs.xml file.
